## Project Description

Welcome to the Donation Campaign Website, a platform dedicated to promoting and managing donation campaigns seamlessly. This project embodies a MERN stack-based solution that prioritizes user experience, visual appeal, and responsiveness across various devices.

## Key Features

1. **Figma Design Implementation:**
   - The website design closely follows the Figma design, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

2. **Dynamic Navigation:**
   - A responsive navbar with a website logo on the left and menu items (Home, Donation, Statistics) on the right. The active route is highlighted for easy navigation across pages.

3. **Card-Based Homepage:**
   - The homepage displays at least 12 donation cards, arranged in 4 cards per row. Each card features distinct background colors for the card, category, and text/title, following the Figma design.

4. **Donation Details and Donation Page:**
   - Clicking on a card redirects the user to the Donation Details page, providing detailed information about the selected donation. The Donation Page showcases donations made, with cards featuring consistent styling and a "See All" button for more items.

5. **Statistics Page with Pie Chart:**
   - The Statistics page includes a dynamic pie chart illustrating the user's donations against the total donations. The chart represents the percentage of contributions made. It adheres to the Figma design for a cohesive look.

## Bonus Features

1. **Search Functionality:**
   - Implemented a functional search bar allowing users to filter donations by category. Entering a category and clicking the search button filters and displays relevant donations on the homepage.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensured responsiveness across various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) for an optimal viewing experience. The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

3. **404 Route and Reloading:**
   - Created a 404 route to handle page not found errors. Reloading the web app won't result in a page not found error.
